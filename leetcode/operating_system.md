## Operating System Notes
---
### **Process**
A **process** is an instance of a program that is being executed. It has its own memory space and system resources like file descriptors, and it runs independently of other processes.

#### Key Characteristics of a Process:
- **Memory Allocation**: A process is allocated its own separate memory space.
- **Process Control Block (PCB)**: A data structure that stores information about the process, including the state, program counter, and register values.
- **Independence**: Processes do not share memory with each other (unless they use inter-process communication mechanisms).
- **Overhead**: Switching between processes (context switching) is more expensive than thread switching due to the need to save/load entire process states.
- **Burst Time**: The amount of time a process or thread requires to complete its execution on the CPU before it either finishes its task or requires I/O (input/output) operations.

#### Types of Processes:
- **Foreground Process**: A process running directly under user control.
- **Background Process**: A process running without direct user interaction, often handled by the operating system.
- **CPU-bound processes**: These are processes that perform computations and spend most of their time executing on the CPU. Their burst time is typically long.
- **I/O-bound processes**: These processes spend a lot of time waiting for data from external sources (e.g., disk or network). Their burst time is typically short because they frequently require I/O operations.

---
### **Thread**
A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution within a process. It represents a single sequence of execution and shares the memory space of its parent process.

#### Key Characteristics of a Thread:
- **Lightweight**: Threads share memory and resources with other threads in the same process.
- **Context Switching**: Switching between threads within the same process is faster than switching between processes.
- **Thread Control Block (TCB)**: Stores information about the thread, such as the program counter, registers, and the thread's state.
- **Concurrency**: Threads within the same process can run concurrently on multiple processors or cores, allowing parallel execution.

#### Types of Threads:
- **User Threads**: Managed by the user-level library, not the operating system.
- **Kernel Threads**: Managed by the operating system kernel, often used for system-level operations.

---
### **Context Switching**
**Context Switching** is a fundamental concept in operating systems that allows the CPU to switch between processes or threads, enabling multitasking.

#### Key Points About Context Switching:
- **What Happens**: The OS saves the state of the currently running process/thread (its context) and loads the context of the next process/thread to execute.
- **Components Saved**: CPU registers, program counter, and the Process Control Block (PCB) or Thread Control Block (TCB) are updated.
- **Importance**: Allows multitasking, fair resource allocation, and ensures system interactivity.
- **Overhead**: Context switching introduces performance overhead, particularly if done too frequently. The more processes/threads, the higher the overhead.

#### Steps of Context Switching
- Save the context of the current process (e.g., CPU registers, program counter).
- Update the process control block (PCB) of the current process.
- Load the context of the next process from its PCB.
- Update the program counter and CPU registers to the new process’s state.

---
### **Multicore vs. Multiprocessor Systems**

#### **Multicore Systems**
   - **Definition**: A multicore system contains a single processor chip with multiple cores. Each core can independently execute tasks, but they share the same memory and other resources like caches.
   - **Real-World Example**: Modern smartphones (e.g., Apple’s A-series chip) and laptops often feature multicore processors where apps or threads run simultaneously across multiple cores.

#### **Multiprocessor Systems**
   - **Definition**: A multiprocessor system consists of multiple physical processors (CPUs), each with its own cache and resources. These processors work together on shared memory.
   - **Real-World Example**: High-performance servers, such as those used in data centers or cloud computing, typically have multiple processors (e.g., dual-CPU or quad-CPU servers) to handle large-scale computations.

---
### Scheduling
- In an operating system, scheduling refers to the method by which processes and threads are assigned to the CPU for execution. Scheduling is essential for maximizing system efficiency, ensuring fairness, and providing responsive system behavior.
- Process Scheduling is the technique by which the operating system decides which process runs at any given time.
- Thread Scheduling is the method of deciding which thread within a process is executed next, especially when multiple threads are created by the same process.

#### **Scheduling in Multicore and Multiprocessor Systems**
- Scheduling is crucial in multicore and multiprocessor systems to ensure optimal resource utilization and efficient task execution. The **OS scheduler** is responsible for allocating tasks to cores or processors, balancing the load, and minimizing resource conflicts.
- **Multicore Scheduling**: Refers to distributing tasks or threads across multiple cores within the same processor. It's common in modern laptops, smartphones, and workstations.
   
- **Multiprocessor Scheduling**: Refers to distributing tasks across multiple physical processors. It is commonly used in servers, cloud systems, and high-performance computing.

#### **Challenges in Scheduling**
1. **Load Balancing**: Ensure each processor or core is being used efficiently without overloading any specific processor.
2. **Cache Management**: Each core or processor may have its own local cache. Data consistency must be maintained across these caches.
3. **Synchronization**: With multiple cores/processors accessing shared memory, effective synchronization (e.g., locks, semaphores) is required to avoid race conditions.

---
### **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
- FCFS is the simplest scheduling algorithm. It schedules processes in the order they arrive in the ready queue.

#### **Advantages**:
- Simple and easy to implement.
- Fair, as it processes tasks in the order they are received.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- **Convoy Effect**: A long process can delay all shorter processes behind it.
- Not ideal for time-sharing systems or systems requiring low response times.
- **Non-preemptive**: Once a process starts executing, it cannot be interrupted.

#### **Real-World Applications**:
- Suitable for batch systems where tasks are processed sequentially.
- Simple systems where tasks don’t require quick responsiveness (e.g., non-interactive applications).

---
### **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- SJF prioritizes processes based on the shortest burst time (the time required for execution). It selects the process with the smallest burst time for execution next.

#### **Advantages**:
- **Optimal for minimizing average waiting time** when burst times are known in advance.
- Efficient for CPU-bound tasks.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- **Starvation**: Long processes may never get executed if there are always shorter jobs available.
- Requires **knowledge of burst time** in advance, which is often not available in real-time systems.

#### **Real-World Applications**:
- Used in systems where tasks have predictable, short burst times (e.g., embedded systems or certain scientific computations).
- Not suitable for interactive or real-time applications.

---
### **Round Robin (RR)**
- Round Robin allocates a fixed time slice to each process. When the time slice expires, the process is moved to the back of the ready queue, and the next process is scheduled.

#### **Advantages**:
- **Fair**: Every process gets an equal share of CPU time.
- Good for **interactive systems**, where fairness is more important than minimizing turnaround time.
- Simple and easy to implement.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- If the time quantum is too large, it behaves like FCFS.
- If the time quantum is too small, excessive context switching occurs, leading to overhead.
- **I/O-bound processes** might get starved if they need shorter bursts but have to wait for their turn.

#### **Real-World Applications**:
- **Time-sharing systems**: Operating systems like Linux or Windows use Round Robin to ensure fair CPU time distribution among all processes.
- Web servers and real-time systems with frequent context switching.

---
### **Priority Scheduling**
- In Priority Scheduling, each process is assigned a priority. The scheduler selects the process with the highest priority (smallest numerical value) to execute next. This can be either preemptive or non-preemptive.

#### **Advantages**:
- Allows **prioritization** of important tasks.
- Suitable for systems where certain tasks must be executed immediately (e.g., real-time systems).

#### **Disadvantages**:
- **Starvation**: Lower priority tasks might never get executed if higher priority tasks keep arriving.
- Requires a method for assigning priority values.
- Can be complex to manage priorities effectively.

#### **Real-World Applications**:
- **Real-time systems** (e.g., operating systems in aircraft or medical devices).
- **Embedded systems** that process high-priority tasks (e.g., controlling machinery).
- Used in systems where high-priority processes must preempt low-priority ones.

---
### **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**
- Processes are divided into different queues based on their priority or behavior (e.g., interactive processes in one queue, CPU-bound processes in another). Each queue can have its own scheduling algorithm (e.g., FCFS or RR).

#### **Advantages**:
- Provides flexibility by using different scheduling algorithms for different types of processes.
- Effective in systems with varied process behavior.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- **Complex to manage** as it involves multiple queues and policies for each.
- Can lead to **starvation** of lower-priority queues.

#### **Real-World Applications**:
- **Desktop operating systems** like Windows, where interactive tasks (e.g., user input) are prioritized over background tasks.
- **Real-time and embedded systems** that differentiate between high and low priority tasks.

---
### **Multilevel Feedback Queue (MFQ)**
- Multilevel Feedback Queue is an enhancement of multilevel queue scheduling. It allows processes to move between queues based on their behavior (e.g., if a process uses too much CPU time, it is moved to a lower-priority queue).

#### **Advantages**:
- **Adaptive**: It adjusts to the behavior of processes, ensuring fairness and efficiency.
- Can prevent starvation by moving processes between queues.
- Suitable for a variety of system environments.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- **Complex implementation**: Requires tracking the behavior of processes and adjusting priorities dynamically.
- Can still suffer from **starvation** if the number of processes is high and the adjustment mechanism isn't optimal.

#### **Real-World Applications**:
- **Unix-like operating systems** (e.g., Linux) use variants of MFQ for scheduling.
- Suitable for environments where a mix of interactive and CPU-bound tasks needs efficient handling.

---
### **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)**
- EDF is a dynamic priority scheduling algorithm used in **real-time systems**. The process with the earliest deadline is scheduled next.

#### **Advantages**:
- **Optimal for real-time systems** where meeting deadlines is crucial.
- Works well when tasks have strict timing constraints.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- **Preemptive**: Tasks may be preempted, leading to higher overhead.
- **Complexity**: Managing deadlines and ensuring that all deadlines are met can be complex.

#### **Real-World Applications**:
- **Real-time systems** like air traffic control, automotive control systems, and robotics.
- Used in multimedia applications where tasks have strict timing requirements.

---
### **Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)**
- RMS is a fixed-priority algorithm used in **real-time systems**. Tasks with shorter periods (i.e., more frequent execution) are assigned higher priorities.

#### **Advantages**:
- **Optimal for periodic tasks** in real-time systems.
- Simple to implement and widely used in time-critical applications.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- **Only suitable for periodic tasks** with known execution times and periods.
- Assumes tasks are independent and don't share resources.

#### **Real-World Applications**:
- **Embedded systems** where tasks have predictable, periodic behavior.
- Real-time applications such as video streaming or sensor networks.

---
### **Lottery Scheduling**
- Lottery Scheduling is a probabilistic scheduling algorithm. Each process is assigned a set of lottery tickets, and the scheduler picks a ticket randomly. The process with the winning ticket gets the CPU.

#### **Advantages**:
- **Fair** in the long run, as processes have an equal chance to be executed.
- Allows flexible prioritization by assigning more tickets to high-priority tasks.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- **Randomness** can lead to less predictability, especially in real-time systems.
- May result in higher **overhead** due to frequent lottery draws.

#### **Real-World Applications**:
- Used in **cloud computing** environments where fairness is essential among many users.
- Useful in **distributed systems** where load balancing and fairness are critical.

---
### **Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ)**
- WFQ is a packet scheduling algorithm that divides available bandwidth according to weighted priorities. Each process is given a "weight," and the system allocates CPU time based on the relative weights of processes.

#### **Advantages**:
- **Fair** distribution of resources based on priorities.
- Ensures that important processes are allocated more CPU time relative to others.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- **Complexity** in calculating and maintaining weights.
- Not ideal for systems with highly dynamic or unpredictable loads.

#### **Real-World Applications**:
- **Network routers** to schedule packets and ensure fair bandwidth distribution.
- Used in **telecommunication systems** to guarantee quality of service for different types of traffic.

### Memory Management
- Memory management in an Operating System (OS) involves handling **RAM (Random Access Memory)** and **virtual memory**. It ensures efficient use of memory resources, process isolation, and system stability. 
- **Memory management** is essential for efficient operation and ensures that memory resources are allocated and deallocated properly.
- **Paging** and **Segmentation** solve fragmentation problems and help load processes efficiently into memory.
- **Virtual memory** allows processes to exceed physical memory by swapping data to disk.
- **Memory protection** ensures process isolation for better security and stability.

### Key Concepts of Memory Management

#### **Memory Allocation**
   - **Static Allocation**: Memory is allocated at compile time (e.g., global variables in C).
   - **Dynamic Allocation**: Memory is allocated during runtime using functions like `malloc` or `new` in C/C++.

   **Real-World Example**: 
   - **Static**: Global variables like a list of predefined user names stored in the app.
   - **Dynamic**: Allocating memory for user input in a chat application where the size of the input varies.

#### **Contiguous Memory Allocation**
   - Memory is allocated as one large continuous block. 
   - **Problems**: Leads to **external fragmentation** where free memory is scattered in small blocks, making it hard to allocate large chunks.

   **Real-World Example**: 
   - Allocating memory for a large image in a photo-editing app. If the memory isn't contiguous, it might cause slow performance or allocation failure.

#### **Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation**
   - Memory is divided into smaller chunks and can be scattered across physical memory.
   - **Paging** and **Segmentation** are used here.

   **Real-World Example**: 
   - **Paging**: Loading a large document into memory in parts, rather than all at once. Pages of the document are stored in non-contiguous memory blocks.

---
### Memory Management Techniques

#### Paging**
   - **Concept**: Memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called **pages**. The OS uses **page tables** to map virtual addresses to physical memory addresses.
   
   **Real-World Example**: 
   - A web browser where different pages of the website are loaded into separate memory pages, so that the browser doesn’t need all website data in memory at once, improving performance.
   
   **Advantages**:
   - Eliminates **external fragmentation**.

   **Disadvantages**:
   - **Internal fragmentation** may still occur (e.g., the last page may not be fully utilized).

#### Segmentation**
   - **Concept**: Memory is divided into variable-sized segments based on logical structures such as the code, data, stack, etc.
   
   **Real-World Example**: 
   - In a word processor, code, fonts, and user input may be loaded into separate segments, making it easier to update parts of the program without affecting the whole.

   **Advantages**:
   - Logical organization of program data.

   **Disadvantages**:
   - **External fragmentation** (unused gaps between segments).

#### Virtual Memory**
   - **Concept**: Allows processes to use more memory than physically available by swapping data between **RAM** and **disk** (via **swap space**).

   **Real-World Example**: 
   - When running multiple applications like Chrome, Visual Studio, and a game on a computer with limited RAM, the OS uses **virtual memory** to swap inactive data to disk, ensuring each app gets the required memory.

   **Techniques**:
   - **Demand Paging**: Loads pages only when needed (common in large applications).
   - **Swap Space**: The area of disk that is used for virtual memory. When the system runs out of physical memory (RAM), inactive parts of memory are moved to the swap space on the disk to free up RAM for active processes.
   
   
---
### Memory Management Strategies

#### First Fit**
   - Allocate the first available block of memory that fits.
   
   **Real-World Example**:
   - Allocating memory for user input fields in a form on a website. The first memory block that fits the data size is chosen.

#### Best Fit**
   - Allocate the smallest available block of memory that fits.
   
   **Real-World Example**:
   - In a cloud storage system, the smallest available storage space is used for saving small files to avoid wasting large amounts of unused space.

#### Worst Fit**
   - Allocate the largest available block of memory.
   
   **Real-World Example**:
   - In a disk storage system, large video files are allocated the biggest blocks to minimize fragmentation over time.

---
### Memory Protection

- **Memory protection** ensures that one process cannot access another's memory space, helping to prevent errors and security breaches.
   
**Techniques**:
   - **Base Register**: Defines the starting address of a process.
   - **Limit Register**: Defines the end address of a process’s allocated memory.
   - **Access Control**: Ensures processes only access specific memory regions.

**Real-World Example**:
   - In a multitasking OS, when running different apps (e.g., text editor, browser), memory protection ensures that one app cannot accidentally or maliciously modify another app’s memory.

---
### Swapping

- **Swapping** involves moving entire processes between **RAM** and **swap space** to free memory for other processes.

**Real-World Example**:
   - When running a large video editor, the OS may swap inactive sections of the video project to disk, making room for active tasks like real-time previewing or rendering.

---
### Fragmentation

#### External Fragmentation**
   - Occurs when there is enough total free memory, but it's scattered in small blocks that cannot fit a large process.
   
   **Real-World Example**:
   - When running multiple applications on limited RAM, you might face fragmentation if processes are constantly opened and closed.

#### Internal Fragmentation**
   - Happens when memory is allocated in blocks larger than needed, wasting space inside the allocated block.

   **Real-World Example**:
   - A program that allocates memory for an array of 100 elements, but only uses 95 of them, leaving 5 units of memory unused.

---
### Memory Management

- **MMU** is a hardware component that helps translate virtual addresses to physical addresses, enabling efficient memory management.
   **Real-World Example**:
   - In a game, MMU ensures that the game’s assets (textures, sounds) are loaded into the correct memory addresses when needed.
- Memory Management Algorithms:
   - **Clock Algorithm**: Efficient, approximates **LRU**, and avoids high overhead.
   - **LRU**: Good for approximating optimal performance but can be complex.
   - **FIFO**: Simple but inefficient, especially in certain access patterns.
   - **OPT**: Theoretically optimal, but not feasible to implement.
   - **LFU**: Useful for long-term memory access, but requires maintaining frequency counters.

---
### Clock Algorithm (Second-Chance Algorithm)

#### **Description**:
- The **Clock Algorithm** is an approximation of the **Optimal Page Replacement** algorithm, using a circular queue to manage pages in memory.
- Each page has a **reference bit** (initially set to 0). 
- When a page is accessed, its reference bit is set to **1**.
- When a page needs to be replaced, the **clock hand** moves in a circular fashion:
  - If the reference bit is **0**, the page is replaced.
  - If the reference bit is **1**, the reference bit is reset to **0** and the hand moves to the next page.
- Note: When a new page needs to be loaded into memory and there is no free space, the algorithm starts checking pages from the position of the pointer (clock hand).
  
#### **Benefits**:
- **Efficient** and faster than algorithms like **FIFO** and **LRU** because it avoids maintaining a full access history.
- **Good approximation** of **LRU** without needing complex data structures.

#### **Example**:
- With pages **A, B, and C** and a clock hand, if page **C** is not used often, it would be replaced when the memory needs to be freed.

---
### Least Recently Used (LRU)

#### **Description**:
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)** replaces the page that has not been used for the longest time.
- Maintains an **access history** of pages to track which page hasn't been used for the longest period.

#### **Benefits**:
- **Effective** at approximating the optimal page replacement strategy.
- **Widely used** in modern systems.

#### **Drawbacks**:
- **Overhead** in maintaining access history (e.g., using a **queue** or **linked list**).
- **Complex implementation**.

#### **Example Cache**:
- Suppose you have a cache with a fixed size, and the system needs to manage pages or data that are frequently accessed.
- When a new page is requested, if it's not already in the cache, the system needs to load it.
- If the cache is full, the least recently used page (the one that hasn't been accessed in the longest time) is replaced with the new one.

---
### First In First Out (FIFO)

#### **Description**:
- **FIFO** is a simple algorithm where pages are replaced in the order they were loaded into memory.
- A **queue** holds the pages in memory. The page at the front of the queue is the **oldest** and gets replaced when a page fault occurs.

#### **Benefits**:
- **Simple to implement**.
- **Low overhead**.

#### **Drawbacks**:
- **Poor performance** with certain access patterns (especially for workloads with **locality of reference**).
- **Belady’s anomaly**: In some cases, increasing the number of page frames can increase the number of page faults.

---
### Optimal Page Replacement (OPT)

#### **Description**:
- The **Optimal (OPT)** algorithm selects the page that will not be needed for the longest time in the future.
- While this minimizes page faults, it requires knowing the future access pattern, which is not feasible.

#### **Benefits**:
- **Theoretical best performance**, minimizing the number of page faults.

#### **Drawbacks**:
- **Impossible to implement** in practice since it requires future knowledge of memory accesses.

---
### Least Frequently Used (LFU)

#### **Description**:
- The **LFU** algorithm replaces the page that has been accessed the **least frequently** over time.
- Each page maintains a **frequency counter** that tracks how often it has been accessed.

#### **Benefits**:
- **Useful for long-term memory access patterns**.
  
#### **Drawbacks**:
- **Complexity** in maintaining and updating frequency counts.

---
### **Synchronization**
- refers to the coordination of processes or threads in a concurrent system, ensuring that resources are shared safely and efficiently. Without synchronization, concurrent processes may lead to race conditions, data inconsistency, or corruption.

### **Key Concepts:**
- **Race Condition**: Occurs when multiple threads/processes access shared data simultaneously, leading to unpredictable results.
- **Critical Section**: A part of the code where shared resources are accessed. Only one thread should execute the critical section at a time.
- **Mutual Exclusion**: Ensures that only one thread/process can access a critical section at a time.

### **Common Synchronization Mechanisms:**
#### **Locks**:
   - **Mutex** (Mutual Exclusion): A mechanism to ensure that only one thread can access a critical section at a time. If a thread locks a mutex, others must wait until it's released.
   - **Spinlock**: A type of lock where a thread continuously checks if the lock is available, using CPU resources during this waiting period.

#### **Semaphores**:
   - **Counting Semaphore**: Allows multiple threads to access a shared resource up to a specified limit.
   - **Binary Semaphore**: Similar to a mutex, only allowing two states (0 or 1), typically used for signaling.

#### **Monitors**:
   - A high-level synchronization construct that combines locking and condition variables to manage access to shared resources.

#### **Condition Variables**:
   - Used in conjunction with locks to allow threads to wait for a certain condition to become true before proceeding.

#### **Common Synchronization Problems:**
- **Lost Wakeups**: Occurs when a thread that should be signaled to wake up misses the signal.
- **Starvation**: When a thread is perpetually denied access to a resource because others are favored.

---
### **Deadlock**
- is a situation in concurrent systems where a set of processes are blocked, each waiting for resources held by the other, and none of them can proceed. It is a fundamental problem in multi-threaded and multi-process systems.

### **Conditions for Deadlock:**
- A deadlock can occur if all of the following conditions hold simultaneously:
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode (only one process can use it at a time).
2. **Hold and Wait**: A process holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other processes.
3. **No Preemption**: A resource cannot be forcibly taken away from a process; it must be released voluntarily.
4. **Circular Wait**: A set of processes exists such that each process is waiting for a resource held by the next process in the set.

### **Deadlock Prevention:**
- To prevent deadlock, we can break one or more of the four necessary conditions:
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Some resources can be shared, but this is often impractical for certain resources (like files).
2. **Hold and Wait**: Require processes to request all resources at once, preventing hold and wait situations.
3. **No Preemption**: If a process is holding some resources and requesting others, the system may preempt the resources and allocate them to other processes.
4. **Circular Wait**: Prevent circular wait by ordering resources and requiring processes to request resources in a specific order.

### **Deadlock Avoidance:**
- In deadlock avoidance, the system ensures that it will never enter a deadlock state by using algorithms that dynamically check the system's resource allocation state.

- **Banker's Algorithm**: A famous deadlock avoidance algorithm that checks whether a resource allocation will lead to a safe state. If allocating a resource leaves the system in an unsafe state, the allocation is denied. A system is in a safe state if there exists at least one process that can complete. 

### **Deadlock Detection and Recovery:**
- **Detection**: The system periodically checks for cycles in the resource allocation graph or uses other algorithms to identify processes that are involved in deadlock.
- **Recovery**: After detecting deadlock, the system must recover by either:
  - **Terminating one or more processes** involved in the deadlock.
  - **Rolling back** processes to some safe state.

### **Deadlock vs. Livelock vs. Starvation:**
- **Livelock**: A situation where processes are actively trying to avoid deadlock but are still stuck in a loop of continuous activity, not making progress.
- **Starvation**: A situation where a process is perpetually denied access to resources, even though other processes are not necessarily deadlocked.

### Key Differences between Synchronization and Deadlock**

| **Feature**         | **Synchronization**                                             | **Deadlock**                                                    |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**      | Ensuring safe and coordinated access to shared resources.       | A condition where processes are blocked in a cyclic wait state. |
| **Objective**       | To avoid race conditions and ensure proper execution order.     | To detect and resolve cyclic dependencies among processes.      |
| **Mechanism**       | Locks, Semaphores, Monitors, etc.                               | Deadlock prevention, avoidance, detection, and recovery.        |
| **Outcome**         | Coordinated execution and resource access.                      | Processes are blocked and cannot continue execution.            |
| **Solutions**       | Locks, Semaphores, Mutex, Condition Variables, etc.             | Prevention, Avoidance, Detection & Recovery.                    |

### **Semaphore vs Mutex in C/C++**
- **Mutex** and **Semaphore** are synchronization primitives used in multi-threaded programming to prevent **race conditions** and **ensure safe access to shared resources**.
- They have similar purposes but work differently and are suited to different use cases.

#### **Key Differences**

| **Aspect**                 | **Mutex**                                                                                   | **Semaphore**                                                                                        |

| **Definition**             | Mutual exclusion lock that allows **only one thread** to access a resource at a time.       | A counter-based synchronization primitive that controls access to **multiple resources**.            |
| **Type**                   | Binary (locked/unlocked)                                                                    | Can be **counting** (any integer ≥ 0) or **binary** (0 or 1).                                        |
| **Ownership**              | Has **ownership**: the thread that locks must unlock it.                                    | **No ownership**: any thread can signal (release) or wait (acquire).                                 |

### Threads and Coroutines in C/C++

#### **Definition**
- **Thread**: 
  A thread is a unit of execution within a process. Threads are created and managed by the operating system and run independently. Threads are often used to achieve true **parallelism** on multi-core processors.
- **Coroutine**:
  A coroutine is a **lightweight** unit of execution that is cooperatively scheduled. Coroutines are generally managed by a user-space library and not directly by the operating system. They are used to perform **asynchronous programming** and are typically used to simplify I/O-bound tasks.

#### **Execution Model**
- **Thread**: 
  Threads execute **concurrently**, and the operating system's **scheduler** decides when and how threads run. Threads can run in parallel if the system has multiple cores.
- **Coroutine**:
  Coroutines execute **consecutively**, yielding control at specific points. A coroutine suspends its execution voluntarily, allowing other coroutines or tasks to execute in the meantime.

#### **Management**
- **Thread**:
  Threads are managed by the **operating system**. Creating and managing threads involves OS-level system calls, and threads are typically scheduled by the OS scheduler.
- **Coroutine**:
  Coroutines are usually managed by a **runtime library** (e.g., **libco**, **Boost.Coroutine**, or **C++20 coroutines**). The library schedules the coroutines based on when they yield and resume their execution.

#### **Context Switching**
- **Thread**:
  Thread context switching is typically more **expensive** as the operating system needs to save and restore the entire context (e.g., registers, stack, etc.). This can lead to overhead when switching between threads, especially with a large number of threads.
- **Coroutine**:
  Coroutines have **minimal context switching** overhead. When a coroutine yields, only a **small stack** and a few registers need to be saved. This makes coroutines much more lightweight compared to threads, especially for I/O-bound tasks.

#### **Parallelism**
- **Thread**:
  Threads are designed for **true parallelism**, making them suitable for CPU-bound tasks. On multi-core systems, threads can execute in parallel, taking full advantage of multiple CPUs or cores.
- **Coroutine**:
  Coroutines do not run in parallel but are **concurrent**. They allow cooperative multitasking where only one coroutine executes at any given time, making them more suitable for **I/O-bound tasks** like file reading, network requests, or asynchronous computation.

#### **Synchronization**
- **Thread**:
  Threads require **synchronization mechanisms** (e.g., **mutexes**, **semaphores**, **condition variables**) to safely share data between threads. Improper synchronization can lead to **race conditions**, **deadlocks**, and other concurrency issues.
- **Coroutine**:
  Coroutines typically avoid traditional synchronization mechanisms. They rely on **cooperative scheduling**, meaning that a coroutine only yields control at specific points. However, when coroutines share resources, synchronization may still be required, especially in concurrent I/O operations.

#### **Use Case**
- **Thread**:
  - Suitable for **CPU-bound tasks** that require parallel execution, such as image processing, numerical computations, or simulations.
  - Used in systems where you need **true concurrency** and parallel execution, like in multi-core processors.
- **Coroutine**:
  - Best suited for **I/O-bound tasks** that require waiting (e.g., database queries, web requests) without blocking the main thread.
  - Great for **asynchronous programming** and event-driven applications like **web servers**, **game engines**, or **UI applications** that need to handle multiple tasks concurrently without blocking.

#### **Error Handling**
- **Thread**:
  Threads typically require more explicit error handling mechanisms. Exceptions thrown in a thread do not propagate back to the main thread, so communication and error handling across threads can be tricky.
- **Coroutine**:
  Error handling in coroutines is easier because the **exception propagation** model is more straightforward. Coroutines typically propagate exceptions just like normal functions, making error handling more intuitive.

#### **C++ Support**
- **Thread**:
  - **C++11** introduced native support for threads via the `<thread>` library, making it easy to create and manage threads.
  - Threads are part of the **standard library** and are integrated with C++'s synchronization mechanisms (e.g., `std::mutex`, `std::lock_guard`).
- **Coroutine**:
  - **C++20** introduced native support for coroutines via the `<coroutine>` header. It provides mechanisms for asynchronous programming with `co_await`, `co_yield`, and `co_return`.
  - Coroutines are less common than threads and are mostly used for **asynchronous** programming.

#### **Key Differences**
| **Aspect**           | **Thread**                                | **Coroutine**                            |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**        | Concurrent (OS-scheduled)                 | Concurrent (user-scheduled, cooperative) |
| **Context Switching**| High overhead (OS-level)                  | Low overhead (library-managed)           |
| **Memory**           | Requires separate stack for each thread   | Lightweight, uses shared stack memory    |
| **Synchronization**  | Requires explicit synchronization         | Cooperative, often no traditional locking|
| **Use Case**         | CPU-bound tasks (parallelism)             | I/O-bound tasks (asynchronous)           |

### File System Architecture**

#### **File System Layout**
- **Boot Sector**: Contains the bootloader and essential file system information.
- **Superblock**: Contains metadata about the file system structure (e.g., size, block size, free space).
- **Data Blocks**: Store actual file data.
- **Inode Table**: Contains file metadata (e.g., file owner, permissions, location of data blocks).

#### **File Metadata**
- File metadata refers to information about a file, such as:
  - **File Name**
  - **File Size**
  - **File Type**
  - **Permissions** (read, write, execute)
  - **Timestamps** (created, modified, accessed)
  - **File Owner**

---
### File System Operations**

#### **File Creation**
- When a file is created, the file system allocates disk space, updates metadata, and assigns a unique identifier (e.g., inode in ext file systems).

#### **File Deletion**
- The file system marks the file as deleted, freeing up the disk space for reuse, but the data might still be present until overwritten.

#### **File Reading and Writing**
- **File Read**: The system reads the data blocks of the file and presents them to the application.
- **File Write**: The system writes data into the allocated blocks and updates the file's metadata (e.g., size, modification time).

#### **File Access**
- **Sequential Access**: Files are read from start to end.
- **Random Access**: Allows reading and writing to any part of the file directly.

#### **File Linking**
- **Hard Links**: Multiple file names refer to the same data blocks. Deleting one link doesn’t remove the file if other links exist.
- **Soft Links (Symbolic Links)**: A reference to another file. If the original file is deleted, the symbolic link becomes broken.

---
### **File System Features**

#### **Journaling**
- **Journaling** helps maintain file system integrity by keeping track of changes before they are committed. It helps recover from crashes or power failures.

#### **Permissions and Security**
- **File Permissions**: Control access to files and directories using read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, group, and others.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: More granular control over file permissions, allowing different users and groups to have different levels of access.

#### **Disk Quotas**
- **Disk Quotas**: Used to limit the amount of disk space a user or group can consume. This helps manage resources on shared systems.
